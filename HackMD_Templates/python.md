### General Python Setup instructions:
Python, PyCharm, Anaconda and Visual Studio Code are packaged for installation on University Windows computers and should be available in Software Center.
Python can be installed on a personal computer with admin rights.  Use using the [instructions from The Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python)

### Python IDEs you may like to use
