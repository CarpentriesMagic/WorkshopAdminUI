### Terminals
Git for Windows (Git Bash) is packaged for installation on **University Windows computers** and should be available in Software Center
If Git for Windows is not installed, you can [download **MobaXterm Portable Edition**](https://download.mobatek.net/2522025040602403/MobaXterm_Portable_v25.2.zip) from [MobaXterm Website](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and follow our [MobaXterm Setup guide](https://hackmd.io/@RSETeam/MobaXterm) for today's workshop.

#### Setting up MobaXterm on your Windows machine:
This will be covered during the workshop

##### Differences between bash implementations
MobaXterm and Git Bash _emulate_ the Unix Shell environment and some commands have default options which are different from bash on a linux system and the default zsh on Mac.
You may notice that you have to install some packages in MobaXterm, which are available by default in Git Bash and...
`sort` behaves like `sort -n` (sorts numerically by default)
`grep` behaves like `grep -E` (interprets regular expressions by default)
